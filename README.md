# Arkanoid
A Block Remover Arcade Game

This is My final project in "OOP" intro course at Bar-Ilan Uneversity. 
That's An Arkanoid game in Java. The game is based on the OOP principles learned throghout the course.
The game supports a "HighScrores" file that changed depends on the highes scores of the users, 
and also supports levels with increasing difficulty.
